# Bomberman
My C++ project

Controls:
Guy in a white suit (top left corner): move - WASD, bomb - Space (use left hand)
Guy in a black suit (bottom right corner): move - arrows, bomb - Numpad 0 (use right hand)

Maybe you cannot just download this repository and play the game. But you can try to run Bomberman/Debug/Bomberman.exe =)
